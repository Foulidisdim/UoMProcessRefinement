This repository contains a series of exercises that contirbuted to my final grade for the Business Process Optimization course on the 5th semester. Process modeling and analysis (BPMN/DMN) on an inneficient public sector procedure, as well as optimization techniques are covered.

The exercises are designed to build upon each other, with some refining previous weeks' work and others introducing new concepts in process optimization.
