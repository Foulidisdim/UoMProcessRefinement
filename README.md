# UoMProcessRefinement

This repository contains a series of exercises that contirbuted to my final grade for the Process Optimization course on the 5th semester. Process modeling and analysis (BPMN/DMN) as well as Optimization techniques are covered.
The exercises are designed to build upon each other, with some refining previous weeks' work and others introducing new concepts in process optimization.
